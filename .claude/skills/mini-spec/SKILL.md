description: "**MANDATORY: Invoke BEFORE writing or modifying any code.** Without `design/design.md` you lack critical knowledge of component relationships, responsibilities, and code mappings — changes made without this context risk breaking architectural invariants. Do NOT explore code with other tools first. Load this skill before doing anything else."

# Mini-spec

## Load the model first

**IMMEDIATELY invoke `/minimap` using the Skill tool before doing anything else.** It carries the structural *model* this skill builds on: the 3-level spec→design→code layout, what each level is for, where artifacts live, the **root spec index**, what a **summary spec** is, and the **traceability links** (`Rn` → CRC card → code `// CRC:/Seq:` comment) that stitch the levels together. Start at the design docs and the root index, not at code — drop into code-level tools (Serena, Grep, etc.) only after they've oriented you. This skill adds the **process** — phases, traceability *maintenance*, gaps, migrations, trajectory tracking — on top of that model.

## Prerequisite: Version Check and Comment Patterns

**First**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec check-version` to verify the tool is installed and matches this skill's version. If it fails, warn the user: the tool and skill must be the same version or there will be compatibility issues.

**Then**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec query comment-patterns` to learn the recognized comment patterns for traceability comments in code files.

## MANDATORY: Create Tasks First

**BEFORE reading any files or doing any work**, create tasks for applicable phases:

```
TaskCreate: "Spec Phase: [feature name]"
TaskCreate: "Requirements Phase: [feature name]"
TaskCreate: "Design Phase: [feature name]"
TaskCreate: "Implementation Phase: [feature name]"
TaskCreate: "Simplification Phase: [feature name]"
TaskCreate: "Gaps Phase: [feature name]"
```

Do NOT proceed until tasks exist. This is required for user visibility into progress.

## MANDATORY: Check for In-Flight Migrations

Before any phase, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec query migrations`. It
lists in-flight migration specs (the `*.md` files in
`specs/migrations/`, excluding `complete/`). Each file is an
in-process migration — record formats, APIs, or internal structures
are mid-flux. If any are present:

- Surface them to the user before doing other work.
- In-flight migrations take priority. Do not start unrelated changes
  that touch the same code paths until the migration is complete.
- If your task IS the in-flight migration, proceed.

Migrations are temporary by design — see "Migration Workflow" below.

---

## Why the levels matter

(*The 3-level model itself — what specs, design, and code each are, and where
they live — is in `/minimap`. This skill is the **process** that builds and
maintains them.*)

Each level exists because skipping it has a concrete cost:

- **Verification** — Design is smaller than code. The user can confirm you understood the task *before* you write hundreds of lines.
- **Preview** — The design tells the user what you're about to change. Without it, they discover unwanted modifications after the fact.
- **Reference** — During implementation, you look up the design instead of re-reading all the code. This keeps changes consistent across files.
- **Anchor** — Without a design document, iterative modifications cause **drift**: features silently disappear as code evolves across sessions. The design pins what must survive.
- **Traceability** — The specs→requirements→design chain ensures nothing is lost between what the user asked for and what gets built. When something breaks, you can trace backward to find out why.

The phases are not ceremony. They are cheaper than debugging a misunderstood requirement after 500 lines of code.

## Summary specs — maintenance

(*What a summary spec **is**, and the recurring kinds — CLI inventory, storage
layout, API surface, capabilities — are in `/minimap`. This is the maintenance
side: when to create one, and how to keep it true.*)

When to create one:

- A question of the form "what's the full set of X across this
  project?" keeps coming up, and answering it requires touching many
  per-feature specs.
- A cross-cutting axis has enough items that someone (or some future
  you) would want a directory to navigate them.

Maintenance rules:

- **Per-feature specs are canonical; summary specs are mirrors.**
  When the two disagree, the per-feature spec wins. Update the summary
  to match.
- **Per-feature anchoring does not maintain summary specs.** Mini-spec's
  normal anchoring (specs → requirements → design → code) catches the
  per-feature edits but cannot tell that a CLI-inventory or
  capabilities spec should also have been updated. Updating summary
  specs is the maintainer's job, performed explicitly.
- **Pin the summary-spec list somewhere persistent** — typically
  CLAUDE.md or the project's top-level reference doc — so a future
  agent or maintainer knows which summary specs to keep in sync when
  they add, rename, or retire something along the relevant axis.
- **Don't anchor new requirements from a summary spec.** Rn numbers
  belong to the per-feature spec that owns the behavior. A summary
  spec entry references that spec; it does not own the contract.

## Task Tracking

**During implementation**, break down into per-file tasks:
```
TaskCreate: "Implement view.ts changes"
TaskCreate: "Implement viewlist.ts changes"
TaskCreate: "Update design docs"
```

**Mark phases complete** with TaskUpdate as you finish them.
**Use Quality Checklist items** as tasks before finalizing.

## Core Principles
- use SOLID principles, comprehensive unit tests
- when adding code, verify whether it needs to be factored
- Code and specs as MINIMAL as possible
- Before using a callback, see if a collaborator reference would be simpler
- write idiomatic code for the language you use
- avoid holding locks in sections that have significant functionality
- **No unanchored design:** every design artifact must trace back to a spec item and requirement. If you need to add something to the design, add it to specs first, then requirements, then design. This applies regardless of direction — even when documenting existing code, verify the spec anchor exists before updating design. This prevents features from existing only in the AI's interpretation.
- **Supersede at the source:** the mirror of "No unanchored design." A change is complete only when every directive describing the *old* behavior is removed or rewritten **at its source** — across specs, requirements, AND design prose. Anchoring keeps features from vanishing; superseding keeps stale directives from causing reverts: a future agent reads a leftover spec sentence or design bullet as current intent and "fixes" the code back to match, undoing the change that obsoleted it. Completion test for any change: could an agent reading only specs + design be led to undo it? If yes, a trap remains.
- in HTML, use the slimmest DOM Possible. Fewer elements makes everything in the browser better: less memory, more speed, better responsiveness

### Why anchoring matters

Specs and design docs are the project's memory bank. AI context dies every
session — code changes compound across sessions without any single agent
seeing the full history. Unanchored code has no justification trail: a
future session can't tell whether a function was designed or accidental,
required or leftover. When that session makes changes, unanchored features
silently disappear because nothing in the design said they should exist.

Anchoring is cheap (a few lines of spec + a requirement number). The cost
of *not* anchoring is discovering, three sessions later, that a feature
vanished during an unrelated refactor and no one noticed because the design
never mentioned it. The spec is the pin that says "this must survive."

### Why superseding matters

Anchoring and superseding guard opposite failure directions. Anchoring fights
*omission* — a feature with no spec silently disappears. Superseding fights
*contradiction* — a directive that outlived the behavior it described silently
reappears. The second is the more dangerous: a contradiction in the design is a
trap that springs in the *revert* direction. A retired requirement has a forcing
function (the `retire` command strikes it through, appends the Tn, and prints a
reconcile reminder), but the *prose* that spawned it — the originating spec
sentence, the CRC bullet, the sequence step — has none. It rots in place until a
future agent reads it as current intent and "fixes" the code back to match. So
retirement is not done when the `Rn` is struck out; it is done when every
sentence that described the old behavior is gone or rewritten at its source.

## Cross-cutting Concerns

`design.md` Cross-cutting Concerns section: Patterns spanning components (auth, errors, logging, routing, theming).
Referenced from other design artifacts: Cards, sequences, and layouts can all say "see cross-cutting: auth"

## Traceability

`design.md` Artifacts section: design files with code file checkboxes.

**Use minispec commands for checkbox operations:**
```bash
# View current artifact states
~/.claude/bin/minispec query artifacts

# Before modifying code: uncheck the artifact
~/.claude/bin/minispec update uncheck design.md crc-Store.md

# After implementation matches design: check the artifact
~/.claude/bin/minispec update check design.md crc-Store.md
```

**Code changes:** Uncheck artifact, ask user: "Update design, specs, or defer?"
**Update design:** Read code, update design file, re-check artifact.

## Workflow

**First:** Read specs. Specs must indicate language/environment.

**Then:** Proceed through phases

1. Spec Phase
Create in `specs/`: human-readable descriptions organized by feature
area. Specs are the user's intent in their own words. For applications,
this means behavior and user-facing concepts. For libraries, include
the public API signatures — they are the contract that design must
satisfy. Do not include internal structure or implementation choices.

**Reconcile the root spec index.** Whenever you add, rename, or retire a
per-feature spec, straighten out the root index (the project's
`specs/index.md`) in the same pass: create it if it doesn't exist yet, then
make sure every spec has an entry under a system, with new summary specs and
themes registered. Run `~/.claude/bin/minispec query unindexed-specs` — it
lists any per-feature spec missing from the index (the spec-level analog of
`query uncovered`); the pass is clean when that list is empty.

**Upon completion**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase spec` to verify spec files exist, then offer Requirements Phase. Do not jump to Design.

2. Requirements Phase
Create `design/requirements.md`: merge all specs into numbered requirements.

Format:
```markdown
# Requirements

## Feature: [feature-name]
**Source:** specs/feature.md

- **R1:** [requirement from spec]
- **R2:** [requirement from spec]
- **R3:** [inferred requirement - marked as such]

## Feature: [another-feature]
**Source:** specs/another.md

- **R4:** [requirement]
```

Guidelines:
- Each spec item becomes exactly one numbered requirement (R1, R2, ...)
- Numbering is global across all features (not per-feature)
- Mark inferred requirements explicitly: "**R5:** (inferred) ..."
- Keep requirement text atomic and testable

**Upon completion**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase requirements` to verify format, then offer Design Phase. Do not jump to Implementation.

3. Design Phase
Create in `design/`:
- `design.md`: Intent + Artifacts (design files → code file checkboxes)
- `crc-*`: CRC cards (see format below)
- `seq-*`: sequence diagrams (≤150 chars wide; number their steps — see "Numbered Sequence Anchors" below)
- `ui-*`: ASCII layouts, reference CRC cards
- `test-*`: test designs (see format below)
- `manifest-ui.md`: routes, theme, global components

**Design Traceability:** All design artifacts must reference requirements:
```markdown
# ClassName
**Requirements:** R1, R3, R7
```

Use minispec to add requirement references:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/minispec update add-ref crc-Store.md R5
```

**Where requirement refs count.** `minispec validate` computes
requirements→design coverage from each CRC card's **top-line
`**Requirements:**` field only** (plus approved gaps). Refs written
anywhere else in the card body — e.g. a per-method `(R5, R6)`
annotation on a `## Does` bullet — are documentation; the validator
does not parse them, so they earn a requirement no coverage. A
requirement counts as covered only when it appears in some artifact's
top-line field, which is what `add-ref` maintains. Body-level
annotations are fine as human notes, but never let them be the *only*
home for a ref. (Requirements→code coverage is separate: it comes
from inline `Rn` refs in code traceability comments. Retired
requirements are skipped by both coverage checks yet still resolve as
references, so a ref to a retired Rn is never flagged as unknown.)

**Artifacts Format** (must be exact for `minispec` tool parsing):
```markdown
## Artifacts

### CRC Cards
- [x] crc-Store.md → `src/store.ts`
- [x] crc-View.md → `src/view.ts`, `src/viewlist.ts`

### Sequences
- [x] seq-crud.md → `src/store.ts`, `src/view.ts`

### UI Layouts
- [ ] ui-dashboard.md → `web/html/dashboard.html`

### Test Designs
- [ ] test-Store.md → `src/store_test.ts`
```
The Artifacts section is a **manifest of all design files** except design.md and requirements.md. Every crc-*, seq-*, ui-*, test-*, and manifest-*.md must be listed.

Format rules:
- Section headers (`### CRC Cards`, etc.) are optional grouping
- Each line: `- [x] design.md → code-file(s)` or `- [ ] design.md`
- Multiple code files: comma-separated after `→`
- Backticks around code paths are optional
- Checkbox state applies to all code files on that line

**Numbered Sequence Anchors:** Number the steps in your sequence diagrams using dotted notation so code can pin to specific steps. Place the number wherever the diagram style allows:

- Tree/outline: `1.4. step description` on the line itself
- UML actor-lane: `1.4` on its own line directly above the arrow
- Mermaid/pseudo-Mermaid: `1.4` at the start of the step

A file may contain more than one numbered diagram. Items in the first numbered diagram begin with `1.`, the second with `2.`, and so on (`1`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`, `2`, `2.1`, ...). The first segment K is the diagram index. Numbers are local to the file: `1.4` in seq-foo.md is unrelated to `1.4` in seq-bar.md.

Reference a numbered step from code with `Seq: seq-foo.md#1.4`. File-only refs (`Seq: seq-foo.md`) remain valid for diagrams that aren't numbered.

**Why number:** the anchor creates a bidirectional, grep-able link.
- Agent generating code: drop `seq-foo.md#1.4` in a traceability comment as a promise that this code implements that step.
- Agent making a code change: follow the anchor to verify what the diagram says the step does.
- Human reading code: `grep "seq-foo.md#1.4" src/` finds every implementation of that step.

For this to work, the number must be uniquely findable in the diagram source (avoid prose that starts with dotted numbers at the same indentation). Within a single file, every dotted ID may appear at most once. Append new steps with new numbers; renumbering existing steps orphans the code that pins to them — same discipline as Rn IDs.

The validator checks per-K tree contiguity (under K.x, children must be K.x.1, K.x.2, … with no gaps), K-sequence contiguity within the file (Ks are 1, 2, 3, …), and intra-file ID uniqueness. Unnumbered seq files are silently skipped — numbering is opt-in per file.

**Upon completion**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase design` to verify coverage, then offer Implementation Phase. Do not jump to Gaps.

4. Implementation Phase
Add traceability comments with optional inline requirement refs:
```
// CRC: crc-Store.md | Seq: seq-crud.md#1.4 | R4, R5
add(data): Item {
```

The third `| Rn, Rn` section is optional but recommended — it links specific code locations directly to requirements, enabling implementation coverage validation.

**What counts as an inline `Rn` ref (v2.10.0+).** `minispec validate`
harvests implementation refs from two comment shapes:

1. **The tail of a `// CRC:` line** — `// CRC: <card> | Seq: <seq> | R5, R12`.
   The parser is `<comment-prefix>CRC:\s*<card>(\| Seq: <seq>)?<rest>`
   and pulls every `Rn` from `<rest>`.
2. **A bare annotation that *leads* with the ref(s)** right after the
   comment leader: `// R5: desc`, `// R5, R6`, or a trailing
   `foo() // R7`. The leading comma-separated refs count. This credits
   the deliberate field/line annotations that sit beside a type's or
   function's `// CRC:` header.

**Ranges (v2.11.0+).** Both shapes expand `Rn-Rm` **range** syntax into
every member, so `// R5-R8` counts R5, R6, R7, and R8 — no need to spell
out a long contiguous span. The second `R` is optional (`R5-8`), ranges
and comma lists mix freely (`// R5-R7, R10`), and a reversed range
(`R8-R5`) contributes only the low ref.

The `<comment-prefix>` is the file's line-comment leader and is
**language-dependent**: `//` for Go/JS/TS/C, `--` for Lua, `#` for
shell/Python, `<!--` for Markdown/HTML, `/*` for CSS. Run `minispec
query comment-patterns` for the per-extension list (and the
block-comment closers below). The examples here are Go. A
`comment_patterns` entry may be an **alternation** (v2.11.0+) — e.g.
`.html: "<!--\s*|//\s*"` so an HTML file's embedded-JS `// Rn`
annotations harvest alongside its `<!-- CRC: … -->` comments.

What still does **not** count, because the ref does not lead the
comment and so reads as prose rather than intent:

- `// computed lazily (R5)` (parenthetical mid-prose)
- `// see R5 for the rationale` (ref after words)
- `// Seq: seq-foo.md | R5` (no `CRC:`; a `Seq:`-only line does not trigger)

A requirement annotated only in prose form reads as "missing impl
coverage." Lead with the ref, or fold it onto the governing `// CRC:`
header (with the card that owns the `Rn`, per its `**Requirements:**`
field), to anchor the code location.

**Block-comment languages:** The `minispec query comment-patterns` output lists any `comment_closers`. If a closer exists for the file extension, you MUST append it to every traceability comment. An unclosed block comment silently swallows all subsequent code. See `config-reference.md` (in this skill directory) if you need to configure closers for a new language.

Mark implemented using minispec:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/minispec update check design.md crc-Store.md
```

Look out for language-specific "gotchas" like mixing functions and methods in Lua.

**Upon completion**, run `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase implementation` to verify traceability, then run the Simplification Phase.

5. Simplification Phase
Invoke the `code-simplifier` agent on the recently modified code. This refines code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving functionality.

**CRITICAL: Preserve all traceability comments.** The `// CRC:`, `// Seq:`, and requirement references (`R123`) in code comments are load-bearing — they connect code to the design artifacts that justify its existence. Removing or reformatting them breaks the traceability chain that `minispec validate` checks. Simplification means cleaner *logic*, not fewer comments.

**Upon completion**, proceed to Gaps Phase.

6. Gaps Phase

**Traceability Verification:**

Run `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase gaps` to validate the gaps section, then run `~/.claude/bin/minispec validate` for full coverage check:

1. **Specs ↔ Requirements:** Each spec item maps to exactly one requirement in `requirements.md`
2. **Requirements ↔ Design:** Each requirement is referenced by at least one design artifact
3. **Requirements ↔ Code:** Each requirement appears as an inline Rn ref in at least one code file

`design.md` Gaps section tracks (use S1/R1/D1/C1/I1/O1/A1/T1 numbering):
- **Spec→Requirements (Sn):** Spec items not captured in requirements.md
- **Requirements→Design (Rn):** Requirements without design artifacts referencing them
- **Design→Code (Dn):** Designed features without code
- **Code→Design (Cn):** Code without design artifacts
- **Implementation (In):** Requirements with design coverage but no inline Rn ref in any code file
- **Oversights (On):** Missing tests, tech debt, enhancements, security concerns, etc.
- **Approved (An):** Approved gap. Permanent — written without a checkbox.
- **'Tired (Tn):** Retired requirement — obsoleted by a later change. Each Tn names the original Rn, the replacement Rn (or "no replacement" if removed outright), and the reason (usually a migration or refactor). Retired Rn entries stay in requirements.md with their original text but get a `~~Rn:~~ (Retired Tn — see Rxxx)` marker so old design/code references still resolve. Permanent — written without a checkbox.

Nest related items with checkboxes (only S/R/D/C/I/O take checkboxes; A and T are permanent and never carry one):
```markdown
- [ ] R1: Requirement R5 has no design artifact
- [ ] O1: Test coverage gaps
  - [ ] Feature A (5 scenarios)
  - [ ] Feature B (3 scenarios)
- A1: Dangling methods, these are never called
  - Maluba.go: Maluba.Frobnicate, Maluba.Enreify
- T1: R1598 retired by R1833 (2026-04-23 ec-rekey)
  - reason: EC keys moved from (fileID, chunkIdx) to chunkID
- T2: R1099 retired by R1281 (2026-04-09 tag-embeddings)
  - reason: V key gained trailing tvid varint
```

If you encounter legacy `- [ ] An:` lines, drop the `[ ]` —
`minispec validate` reports them as `permanent gaps with checkbox`.

Use `minispec update add-gap` to add gaps; it writes the right
shape automatically (no checkbox for A/T, checkbox for the rest).

**Upon completion**, offer to update Documentation (Documentation Phase).

7. Documentation Phase, Optional -- offer to user after Gaps
Create `docs/user-manual.md` and `docs/developer-guide.md` with traceability links.

## Migration Workflow

Specs in `specs/` describe how the system *is* — they're the
canonical "current state." Migration specs describe how to get from
state A to state B. They have a built-in expiration: once
implemented, the "Problem" they describe no longer exists.

To keep `specs/` from accumulating stale migration narratives:

1. **Create migration specs in `specs/migrations/`**, not in
   `specs/`. One file or several — one per coherent migration.
2. **Run the mini-spec phases** on the migration specs as normal
   (Spec → Requirements → Design → Implementation → Simplification
   → Gaps).
3. **When implementation lands**, the migration is complete. The
   code now embodies state B.
4. **Update the affected `specs/*.md` files** to describe state B
   as the current truth — fold in record formats, API contracts,
   or other steady-state material that the migration changed.
5. **Retire obsoleted requirements.** For each obsolete Rn run:

   ```
   ~/.claude/bin/minispec update retire R<old> R<new> "<reason>"
   ```

   Use `-` instead of `R<new>` if there is no replacement. The
   command rewrites the R<old> line in `requirements.md` to
   `**~~R<old>:~~** (Retired Tn — see R<new>) <original text>` AND
   appends a new Tn entry to `design.md` Gaps in one atomic step.
   Outputs the assigned Tn.

   To stderr it also prints a **supersede-at-source reminder** naming
   `R<old>`'s originating spec (its feature's `**Source:**`). Treat
   that reminder as a checklist item, not noise — it points at step 6,
   which applies to *every* retirement, not just migrations.

   If a CRC card or inline code comment still references the
   retired Rn but the code no longer fulfills it, update the
   reference to the replacement Rn. (References to retired Rn in
   code that was removed are fine — the comment went with the
   code.)

6. **Reconcile obsoleted spec *and* design prose — at the source.**
   Retiring a requirement has a forcing function — the `retire`
   command, the Tn entry, the `~~Rn:~~` marker, and the stderr
   reminder. The *prose* that described the old behavior has none.
   Two layers rot silently:
   - **Originating spec prose.** The requirement was born from a
     sentence in its feature's `**Source:**` spec — "current truth,
     the human's intent," the most authoritative trap of all. Follow
     the `**Source:**` the reminder names and rewrite or delete the
     sentence that spawned the retired `Rn`.
   - **Design prose.** CRC `## Does` descriptions, method signatures,
     and sequence diagrams that described state A do not flag
     themselves as stale. Grep `design/` for the changed method
     names, old signatures, and renamed types, and rewrite every CRC
     bullet and seq diagram that still describes the old behavior to
     match state B.

   This is **not migration-only.** Every retirement — standalone or
   part of a migration — owes this reconciliation, and the `retire`
   reminder prompts it each time. `minispec validate` cannot catch
   it: it checks that requirements are *referenced*, not that the
   prose around the reference is accurate. (Step 5 reconciles the
   *Rn references*; this step reconciles the *descriptions* those
   references annotate — a distinct, easily-missed pass.)

7. **Move the migration spec(s).**

   **Precondition — the prose grep.** Before completing, grep the
   retired module/type/old-behavior names across **both** `specs/`
   and `design/`. Every hit must be either gone or framed as a
   historical record (a retirement note, a `complete/` migration
   spec) — **zero stale-as-live mentions.** A grep alone can't tell a
   trap from an accurate "documents the absence" record, so this is
   your judgment, not the tool's. Apply the completion test: could an
   agent reading only specs + design be led to undo the migration? If
   yes, a trap remains — fix it before moving the spec.

   Then run:

   ```
   ~/.claude/bin/minispec update migration-complete <name>
   ```

   The command moves `specs/migrations/<name>.md` to
   `specs/migrations/complete/<NNN>-<name>.md` where NNN is the
   next zero-padded three-digit prefix. Numbers are assigned at
   completion time, not creation time, so concurrent in-flight
   migrations don't fight over numbers and the prefix reflects
   actual landing order. Outputs the new path.

`specs/migrations/complete/` is the migration history — a
chronological record of what changed and why. `specs/` always
reflects the present.

## Trajectory Tracking (PENDING / CURRENT / DONE)

Specs → design → code anchor the project's **structure** — what exists and
why. They do not track its **trajectory**: what's queued, what's in flight,
what just landed. The harness task tool (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`) is
session-local and dies with the session. Trajectory tracking is the durable,
cross-session spine the structural docs and the ephemeral tasks both lack.

It is **tool-agnostic**: it tracks any kind of work — a mini-spec pass, a UI
pass, a plain investigation — each item naming the skill that runs it, or
none. It ships with mini-spec but is not about mini-spec.

### The three files

Named for the states an item passes through: **pending → current → done**
(future → present → past). Default location
`specs/migrations/{PENDING,CURRENT,DONE}.md`; a project may site them
elsewhere (e.g. at top level) and keep a project prefix. The vocabulary
below refers to the project's files **wherever they live**, so a path never
needs qualifying:

- **the pending file** — the work queue.
- **the current file** — working context for the active item.
- **the done file** — the completion ledger.

The standing ledger (exactly one PENDING, one CURRENT, one DONE) sits in the
same `migrations/` directory as the in-flight migration specs. Two kinds of
file share that directory — say so, so `PENDING.md` is never mistaken for a
migration spec.

### Lifecycle rules

- **The pending file is ordered by intent** — the top item is active. Each
  item is a `##` heading, so a paused item's context can nest as a sub-item
  beneath it.
- **Finishing an item:** first mark it done in its **source file** (the
  plan/spec/design doc where the work lives); then reset the current file;
  then move the item from the pending file to the done file.
- **The current file is for the active item only** — never a log of finished
  work (that is the done file). With nothing active, it holds a one-line
  placeholder.
- **Entries are status indicators only** — the source file holds the
  content, design, and rules. No instructions in entries.
- **The done file is most-recent-first.** Each entry records date, title,
  and what landed (commit, requirement ranges, gaps banked, sources) —
  enough to reconstruct the change without re-reading the code.
- **The pending file is the index** back to the roadmap, planning scratch,
  and feature designs.

### File shapes

```markdown
# Pending
<lifecycle rules>
---
## 1. **<title>** (<skill that runs it — or omit>). <one-line status>.
   Source: [<doc>](<path>). Next: <next action>.
## 2. **<title>** …
```
```markdown
# Current
Working context for the active item only — never a log (that's the done
file). To pause: lift this into a sub-item under that item's `##` heading in
the pending file, then reset here, freeing it for what you pick up next.
---
_No active item._
```
```markdown
# Done
Completed items, most-recent first.
- **YYYY-MM-DD — <title>.** <commit, R-range, gaps banked, sources touched>.
```

### Interleaving with migrations

A **state item** and a **migration** are two orthogonal lifecycles,
composable as the work demands:

- A **migration** distills a brainstorm into a concise A→B document that may
  span several steps; it runs the phases and lands in `complete/NNN-`. It
  can be done all-at-once and may never enter the pending queue.
- A **state item** is a unit of queued work, paused and resumed via the
  current file.

They compose; they do not nest by rule. The current file is a **resume
buffer**: to change styles mid-flight, park the active item's context as a
sub-item under its `##` heading (the pending file is a stack you can push
onto), freeing the current file for the migration, then resume later from the
parked sub-item. The freedom to intermix is the point — neither style is
imposed.

### What's reusable vs. project-specific

Reusable core: the three files, the lifecycle, the interleaving model. Each
project parameterizes the rest — routing labels (which skill runs an item),
the planning-scratch location, any batching rules, file siting and case
convention, and whether the files carry a project prefix.

Principles: Single Responsibility, minimal collaborations, PascalCase.

## Test Case Format
```markdown
# Test Design: ComponentName
**Source:** crc-ComponentName.md
## Test: name
**Purpose:** what this validates
**Input:** setup and data
**Expected:** verifiable outcome
**Refs:** crc-*.md, seq-*.md

Cover: happy path, errors, edge cases.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Requirements: all spec items captured, numbered (R1, R2, ...), inferred items marked
- [ ] CRC Cards: nouns/verbs covered, no god classes, Requirements linked
- [ ] Sequences: participants from CRCs, ≤150 chars wide
- [ ] UI Specs: ASCII layouts, refs to CRCs and manifest-ui.md
- [ ] Traceability: design files in Artifacts, code files have checkboxes, all Rn referenced
- [ ] Tests: test-*.md for key behaviors
- [ ] Summary specs: any cross-cutting axis touched by this change has been mirrored in the relevant summary spec (CLI inventory, storage layout, API surface, capabilities, …) — see the project's pinned list
- [ ] Root spec index: every per-feature spec is mapped under a system in the root index (created if absent); `~/.claude/bin/minispec query unindexed-specs` returns empty
- [ ] Phase validation: `~/.claude/bin/minispec phase <phase>` passes after each phase
- [ ] Full validation: `~/.claude/bin/minispec validate` passes

## Minispec Tool

The `minispec` CLI tool (at `~/.claude/bin/minispec`) performs structural operations on design files.

**IMPORTANT:** Always use minispec commands instead of manual editing for:
- Checking/unchecking artifact checkboxes
- Adding requirement references to CRC cards
- Querying artifact states and coverage

```bash
# Version check (run on skill load)
~/.claude/bin/minispec check-version         # Verify tool and skill versions match

# Phase-specific validation (run after each phase)
~/.claude/bin/minispec phase spec            # Verify spec files exist
~/.claude/bin/minispec phase requirements    # Verify requirements format
~/.claude/bin/minispec phase design          # Verify design files and coverage
~/.claude/bin/minispec phase implementation  # Verify code traceability
~/.claude/bin/minispec phase gaps            # Verify gaps section

# Full validation
~/.claude/bin/minispec validate              # Run all validations

# Queries
~/.claude/bin/minispec query artifacts       # Show all artifacts with checkbox states
~/.claude/bin/minispec query uncovered       # List Rn without design refs
~/.claude/bin/minispec query gaps            # List gap items
~/.claude/bin/minispec query requirements    # List all requirements
~/.claude/bin/minispec query migrations      # List in-flight migration specs

# Updates - artifact checkboxes (in design.md)
~/.claude/bin/minispec update check design.md crc-Store.md     # Check artifact
~/.claude/bin/minispec update uncheck design.md crc-Store.md   # Uncheck artifact

# Updates - requirement references (in CRC cards)
~/.claude/bin/minispec update add-ref crc-Store.md R5          # Add requirement to CRC
~/.claude/bin/minispec update remove-ref crc-Store.md R5       # Remove requirement from CRC

# Updates - gaps (S/R/D/C/I/O get checkboxes; A/T are permanent)
~/.claude/bin/minispec update add-gap O "Test coverage needed" # Add oversight gap
~/.claude/bin/minispec update resolve-gap O3                   # Mark gap resolved
~/.claude/bin/minispec update approve-gap D3                   # Convert gap to approved (A) type
~/.claude/bin/minispec update add-gap T "R5 retired by R10"    # Add retired-requirement gap

# Updates - migrations
~/.claude/bin/minispec update retire R5 R10 "2026-04-27 schema-v2"   # Retire R5, replaced by R10
~/.claude/bin/minispec update retire R7 - "no replacement"           # Retire with no replacement
~/.claude/bin/minispec update migration-complete schema-v2           # Move spec to complete/ with NNN- prefix
```

Use the tool to:
- Run phase-specific checks after completing each workflow phase
- Verify design file formats are parseable
- Find uncovered requirements quickly
- Toggle checkboxes atomically (avoid manual checkbox edits)
- Add/remove requirement references to CRC cards
- Add gaps with auto-numbering
