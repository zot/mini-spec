# CRC Methodology

CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) cards are a design technique from the 1980s, originally used with physical index cards. Mini-spec adapts this for AI-assisted development.

## The Three Levels

```
Level 1: Specs      What you want (human-written)
Level 2: Design     What the AI understood (CRC cards, sequences, UI specs)
Level 3: Code       What got built
```

The design level is the key innovation—it makes the AI's interpretation **explicit and reviewable** before expensive code generation.

## CRC Cards

Each card represents a class/component with three sections:

### Knows (Attributes)
What data does this component hold?
- Properties, state, configuration
- Keep minimal—only what's needed for responsibilities

### Does (Behaviors)
What actions can this component perform?
- Methods, operations, responses to events
- Each behavior should be a single responsibility

### Collaborators
What other components does this one work with?
- Dependencies, message targets
- Fewer collaborators = better design

## Why CRC Works

1. **Forces single responsibility** — If a card has too many "Does" items, split it
2. **Reveals coupling** — Too many collaborators signals design problems
3. **Enables walkthroughs** — You can trace scenarios across cards
4. **Fits in context** — Cards are small enough for AI to reason about

## Sequence Diagrams

Show how components collaborate over time:

```
User -> App: click Add
App -> Store: add(data)
Store -> Store: persist
Store -> List: notify
List: re-render
```

Sequences validate that CRC collaborations actually work.

## The Design Review

Before implementation, review the design:

1. **Does it match the spec?** Features shouldn't appear or disappear
2. **Are responsibilities balanced?** No god classes
3. **Are collaborations minimal?** Loose coupling
4. **Are sequences complete?** Happy path + errors

Catching problems here saves tokens and rework.

## Traceability

Code links back to design via comments:
```
// CRC: crc-Store.md | Seq: seq-crud.md
```

Design links to code via Artifacts checkboxes:
```
- [x] src/Store.ts
```

When code changes, uncheck the box. This flags drift for review.
